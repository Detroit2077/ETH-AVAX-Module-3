# Demonstration of ERC20 with example using functions

- `NOTE`: All implementation has been done in REMIX IDE.

## Installation

- To get the repo in your local device you can use

```sh
    > git clone https://github.com/Detroit2077/ETH-AVAX-Module-3.git
```

- Or you can `copy` the code and use directly in your Remix IDE

## Executing Program

Compile the contract:

```sh
In Remix, click on the side section called "Solidity Compiler" and then compile it using "Compile Token.sol"
```

Deploy the contract:

```sh
Now, click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" section, adjust your environment and contract accordingly, and then deploy the contract with initializing the supplyValue
```

Interact with the contract using the deployed instance. You can then pass the parameters and call the mint, burn and transferToken function.
